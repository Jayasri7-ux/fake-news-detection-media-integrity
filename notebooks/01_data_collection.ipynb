       "      <td>Delhi teen finds place on UN green list, turns glass into sand\\n\\nNEW DELHI: Udit Singhal , who founded a startup to turn glass bottles into sand , has been named among 17 people in the United Nation’s 2020 Class of Young Leaders for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The programme is a flagship initiative that recognises the efforts of young people in driving action and galvanising others in support of UN’s 2030 agenda for sustainable development.Singhal, an 18-year-old who lives near Mandi House, told TOI, “I feel proud to represent India. Along with 16 others, I’ll work to motivate youths and achieve SDGs. I hope to be able to encourage communities to inculcate better civic sense to create sustainable living spaces.” The teenager attended the UN function online due to the Covid pandemic. “In the normal scenario, I would have gone to New York,” he added.Singhal had founded Glass2Sand in 2019 as a zero-waste system that turns bottles into economically viable sand. “In 2018, I found a pile of bottles at home. During research, I learnt that ragpickers were not interested in collecting glass bottles because of little demand, high transportation cost and storage space. So empty glass bottles often ended up at the landfills. Do you know it takes a million years for a glass bottle to decompose?”Singhal then imported a machine from New Zealand with a special grant from the New Zealand High Commissioner in India and went to work helped by 65 volunteers, six diplomatic missions and four institutions, collecting bottles from across Delhi. “It takes five seconds to turn one empty glass bottle into sand. We have crushed 8,000 kg of bottles into 4,800 kg of high-grade silica sand so far,” he said. “This silica sand is commercially viable because it is used in construction, including roads and as lining in furnaces. It is more valuable than river sand in making concrete.”Singhal studied in The British School in Delhi and is currently a freshman at University College in London where he is a management sciences student.Other young leaders cited by Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, for “leading the way in shaping a more sustainable and inclusive future for all” belong to the United States, Turkey, China, Pakistan, Peru, Egypt, Senegal, Bulgaria, Nigeria, Brazil, Liberia, Ireland, Colombia, Australia, Uganda and Bangladesh.</td>\n",

Now, with th… https://t.co/VGK1o0pPQb — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1600595705000\\n\\nNEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha on Sunday passed two key farm bills amid a bedlam as opposition members charged towards the podium of the presiding officer, flung the rule book at him, tore official papers and heckled him over their demand for a division of vote.Trouble started when the sitting of the House was extended beyond the scheduled time to allow passage of the bills. Opposition members, who felt such a move should be resorted to only by consensus, rushed into the Well, shouting slogans against the government and accusing it of being anti-farmer.This forced agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar to cut short his reply and deputy chairman Harivansh took up the approval of the bills.Four opposition sponsored motions to send the two bills to a House panel for greater scrutiny were negated by voice vote, but the Congress, TMC, CPM and DMK members sought a division of vote on the issue.As Harivansh over-ruled them saying division of votes can take place only when members are on their seat, TMC leader Derek O'Brien charged towards the podium, thrusting the rule book into the face of the Deputy Chairman.House marshals thwarted the move as also blocking a book that was flung towards Harivansh. An attempt was also made to pulls microphones away from the chair but the marshals physically stopped that from happening.DMK leader Tiruchi Siva, who along with O'Brien, K C Venugopal of Congress and K K Ragesh of CPM had moved resolutions for sending the bills to the select committee, tore papers and flung them into the air.Harivansh, who asked members to go back to their places and not come into the Well due to the Covid-19 protocol requiring physical separation, first muted the audio of the live proceedings but with the ruckus continuing, he adjourned the proceedings for 15 minutes.When the House reassembled, opposition parties chanted slogans but this did not prevent Harivansh from putting the bill to voice vote.As the first bill got voice approval of the House and motions for sending it to a select committee were rejected, at least two members tried to climb on the table of Rajya Sabha officers but were pulled down.Both the bills were passed by voice vote and amendments moved by the opposition parties rejectedHowever, the Congress and other opposition party members sat in protest inside Rajya Sabha even after the House was adjourned for the day after the passage of the two farm bills.The House sitting ends at 1pm and Rajya Sabha chamber has to be sanitised by 3pm when Lok Sabha sits for a session. Both the chambers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are being used for each House to allow members to follow physical distancing norms.As a result, Lok Sabha had to be adjourned till 4pm as Congress members demanded that the House proceedings should not take place till Rajya Sabha galleries are cleared of the agitating members of the Upper House.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu convened a high-level meeting at his residence and is likely to take action against those who created ruckus in the Upper House.Sources told news agency ANI that Rajya Sabha chairman is very upset with the incident and is likely to take action against those who raised slogans against the chair and tore papers.Shortly after the passage of the bills, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal urged President Ram Nath Kovind not to give his assent to the legislations and return them to Parliament for reconsideration.Badal's party had earlier pulled out Harsimrat Kaur Badal from the Union Cabinet in protest against the bills.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Parliament's nod to the two bills on Sunday, describing the passage as a \"watershed moment\" in the history of Indian agriculture.He asserted that they will ensure a complete transformation of the farm sector and empower crores of farmers.In a series of tweets, PM Modi said these proposed laws will liberate farmers from numerous adversities as he noted that peasants were for decades bound by various constraints and bullied by middlemen.He again assured farmers that the existing government support system for them will continue.Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against these bills, with their leaders alleging that the legislations will dismantle the existing system and leave them to the mercy of corporate interests.BJP president J P Nadda said the legislations will give farmers freedom in selling their produce and rid them of middlemen.He also hit out at the opposition parties over the ruckus in the Rajya Sabha after the Chair proceeded to take up the bills for passage as he termed the behaviour \"highly irresponsible\" and an attack on democracy, and hoped that the House chairman will take note of that.Opposition members also violated Covid-19 protocols by storming the Well of the House, he told reporters.</td>\n",

I had tweeted about my incident sometime ago when the #MeToo movement had happened, but many people told me to delete the tweet else I would stop getting work. My manager too advised me to remove the tweet. I complied. Post that, Anurag blocked me on WhatsApp.”  \n",

First of all, they were not ours, they were not from this land. They came from afar and came here to do this. But still, the difference between them (Indian government and Britishers) was that they (Britishers) were educated. They were not this illiterate. At least they didn't do this with Britishers that the government is doing with its own people. Why can't they understand they are Indian. They should talk about India. They tell Congress, they tell others, they tell us - why are you silent about Pakistan? Are we crazy that we should talk about Pakistan? Are you not enough to talk about Pakistan? You are obsessed with Pakistan. You can't think of anything else besides Pakistan. Whenever you speak you always speak about Pakistan. Who will talk about India? Pakistanis did not elect you, we elected you.

Read the caption below. I so badly wish it was true but it isn't. She is my humble sister. Atiya Alvi Siddiqui\".\\n\\nBOOM contacted Atiya Alvi through Facebook. She confirmed that the woman in the video was her. \"I had gone to Mandi House for a protest and that's where this interview happened,\" Atiya told BOOM.

Congress fielded Shukla in 2018 for the Vidhansabha election from Rajnandgaon in Chattisgarh. Karuna Shukla was a member of parliament and was a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, but left the BJP post-2014. She has been vocal about state and other issues and accused the BJP of using Atal Bihari Vajpayee's death for political gains in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \n",

The programme is a flagship initiative that recognises the efforts of young people in driving action and galvanising others in support of UN’s 2030 agenda for sustainable development.Singhal, an 18-year-old who lives near Mandi House, told TOI, “I feel proud to represent India. Along with 16 others, I’ll work to motivate youths and achieve SDGs. I hope to be able to encourage communities to inculcate better civic sense to create sustainable living spaces.” The teenager attended the UN function online due to the Covid pandemic. “In the normal scenario, I would have gone to New York,” he added.Singhal had founded Glass2Sand in 2019 as a zero-waste system that turns bottles into economically viable sand. “In 2018, I found a pile of bottles at home. During research, I learnt that ragpickers were not interested in collecting glass bottles because of little demand, high transportation cost and storage space. So empty glass bottles often ended up at the landfills. Do you know it takes a million years for a glass bottle to decompose?”Singhal then imported a machine from New Zealand with a special grant from the New Zealand High Commissioner in India and went to work helped by 65 volunteers, six diplomatic missions and four institutions, collecting bottles from across Delhi. “It takes five seconds to turn one empty glass bottle into sand. We have crushed 8,000 kg of bottles into 4,800 kg of high-grade silica sand so far,” he said. “This silica sand is commercially viable because it is used in construction, including roads and as lining in furnaces. It is more valuable than river sand in making concrete.”Singhal studied in The British School in Delhi and is currently a freshman at University College in London where he is a management sciences student.Other young leaders cited by Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, for “leading the way in shaping a more sustainable and inclusive future for all” belong to the United States, Turkey, China, Pakistan, Peru, Egypt, Senegal, Bulgaria, Nigeria, Brazil, Liberia, Ireland, Colombia, Australia, Uganda and Bangladesh.  \n",

Now, with th… https://t.co/VGK1o0pPQb — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1600595705000\\n\\nNEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha on Sunday passed two key farm bills amid a bedlam as opposition members charged towards the podium of the presiding officer, flung the rule book at him, tore official papers and heckled him over their demand for a division of vote.Trouble started when the sitting of the House was extended beyond the scheduled time to allow passage of the bills. Opposition members, who felt such a move should be resorted to only by consensus, rushed into the Well, shouting slogans against the government and accusing it of being anti-farmer.This forced agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar to cut short his reply and deputy chairman Harivansh took up the approval of the bills.Four opposition sponsored motions to send the two bills to a House panel for greater scrutiny were negated by voice vote, but the Congress, TMC, CPM and DMK members sought a division of vote on the issue.As Harivansh over-ruled them saying division of votes can take place only when members are on their seat, TMC leader Derek O'Brien charged towards the podium, thrusting the rule book into the face of the Deputy Chairman.House marshals thwarted the move as also blocking a book that was flung towards Harivansh. An attempt was also made to pulls microphones away from the chair but the marshals physically stopped that from happening.DMK leader Tiruchi Siva, who along with O'Brien, K C Venugopal of Congress and K K Ragesh of CPM had moved resolutions for sending the bills to the select committee, tore papers and flung them into the air.Harivansh, who asked members to go back to their places and not come into the Well due to the Covid-19 protocol requiring physical separation, first muted the audio of the live proceedings but with the ruckus continuing, he adjourned the proceedings for 15 minutes.When the House reassembled, opposition parties chanted slogans but this did not prevent Harivansh from putting the bill to voice vote.As the first bill got voice approval of the House and motions for sending it to a select committee were rejected, at least two members tried to climb on the table of Rajya Sabha officers but were pulled down.Both the bills were passed by voice vote and amendments moved by the opposition parties rejectedHowever, the Congress and other opposition party members sat in protest inside Rajya Sabha even after the House was adjourned for the day after the passage of the two farm bills.The House sitting ends at 1pm and Rajya Sabha chamber has to be sanitised by 3pm when Lok Sabha sits for a session. Both the chambers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are being used for each House to allow members to follow physical distancing norms.As a result, Lok Sabha had to be adjourned till 4pm as Congress members demanded that the House proceedings should not take place till Rajya Sabha galleries are cleared of the agitating members of the Upper House.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu convened a high-level meeting at his residence and is likely to take action against those who created ruckus in the Upper House.Sources told news agency ANI that Rajya Sabha chairman is very upset with the incident and is likely to take action against those who raised slogans against the chair and tore papers.Shortly after the passage of the bills, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal urged President Ram Nath Kovind not to give his assent to the legislations and return them to Parliament for reconsideration.Badal's party had earlier pulled out Harsimrat Kaur Badal from the Union Cabinet in protest against the bills.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Parliament's nod to the two bills on Sunday, describing the passage as a \"watershed moment\" in the history of Indian agriculture.He asserted that they will ensure a complete transformation of the farm sector and empower crores of farmers.In a series of tweets, PM Modi said these proposed laws will liberate farmers from numerous adversities as he noted that peasants were for decades bound by various constraints and bullied by middlemen.He again assured farmers that the existing government support system for them will continue.Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against these bills, with their leaders alleging that the legislations will dismantle the existing system and leave them to the mercy of corporate interests.BJP president J P Nadda said the legislations will give farmers freedom in selling their produce and rid them of middlemen.He also hit out at the opposition parties over the ruckus in the Rajya Sabha after the Chair proceeded to take up the bills for passage as he termed the behaviour \"highly irresponsible\" and an attack on democracy, and hoped that the House chairman will take note of that.Opposition members also violated Covid-19 protocols by storming the Well of the House, he told reporters.
